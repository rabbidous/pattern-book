## Apollo and Variations

The standard Apollo (also known as the 1-1-3 Apollo) is a MAJ standard.

| **Juggler** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | E       |         | C       |         |
| **B**       | C       | D       | E       | D       |
| **C**       | B       |         | A       |         |
| **D**       |         | B       |         | B       |
| **E**       | A       |         | B       |         |

> * Right hands counting, all passes with right hand

### Cockeyed Apollo

Change the outside throws to be in a Y and the Apollo becomes cockeyed...so
named because the middle feeder (B) has to throw and catch from opposite
directions.

| **Juggler** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | E       |         | C       |         |
| **B**       | C       | D       | E       | D       |
| **C**       | A       |         | B       |         |
| **D**       |         | B       |         | B       |
| **E**       | B       |         | A       |         |

> * Right hands counting, all passes with right hand

### Apollo Plus

A and D can pass an extra club (triple spin) over the pattern on their right
hand self throw. D starts with the extra club.

This variation works well with the standard Apollo, but is hair raising with the
Cockeyed Apollo.

If that's not exciting enough, add another club to the inner feed (all those
passes are doubles) so it is a 2-count extra club feed.

### Apollo Plus Weave

Here's a nice weave pattern. Start with the 1-1-3 Apollo formation and have B
feed a standard weave of C, D and E. Then A can add an extra club and throw
4-count triples to the ends. (A starts with 4 and a triple to whichever end B
doesn't start with.)

All the weavers will have the following sequence (starting from the outside) B,
self, self, B, self, Triple to A, B.

Also see the 1-2-3 Apollo for 6 jugglers and the 1-2-4 Apollo for 7 jugglers.

The Apollo was invented by N.A.S.A. The Apollo juggling pattern was invented by
the Gemini Jugglers in 1991.

## Mr. Inside-Mr. Outside Weave
![](./media/image36.png)

This is a standard weave where the feeder is divided into two feeder (one
passing on the inside and one on the outside). This is a good warm up pattern
for the Twister Weave. In addition, all of the Twister Weave variations can be
applied to this weave too.

| **Juggler** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**       | C       |         | E       |         | D       |         |
| **B**       |         | D       |         | C       |         | E       |
| **C**       | A       |         |         | B       |         |         |
| **D**       |         | B       |         |         | A       |         |
| **E**       |         |         | A       |         |         | B       |

> * Right hand counting

A is Glen Davis (Mr. Outside), and B is Doc Blanchard (Mr. Inside). This pattern
is the same as the standard weave with 2 feeders (instead of one). The outside
weavers pass to Doc Blanchard, and the inside (middle) weaver passes to Glen
Davis. Feeders A and B pass every other right hand throws (4-count).

![](./media/image37.png)

The same variations for the standard weave and the Twister Weave can be used for
this pattern.

When was this pattern created? We have been doing it since 1994.

## Twister Weave and Variations
![](./media/image38.jpeg)

An animated version of this pattern can be seen at the
[Juggloid website](http://juggloid.com/editor/?s=sU0PC0).

The Twister Weave has the exact same passes as the Mr. Inside Mr. Outside Weave.
However, the Mister Inside Feeder is on the opposite side of the weavers, so the
feedees turn around between every pass.

### Standard Twister Weave (Feeder 4-Count, Feedees 6-Count)

For the standard twister weave each weaver passes once on the end to Mr. Outside (X), and then has a 6-count (2 right hand selves) to move to the inside and turn around. Then pass once to Mr. Inside (Y) and continue in a 6-count outside and then turning around.

The turns may be done by turning towards the inside or towards the outside. Most people find inside turns easier in the middle and on the ends (i.e. back away from the current feeder and then turn towards the new feeder). However, we suggest that you learn both turns and see which combinations you like best.

|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **X**       | A       |         |         |         | C       |         |         |         | B       |          |          |          |
| **Y**       |         |         | B       |         |         |         | A       |         |         |          | C        |          |
| **A**       | X       |         |         |         |         |         | Y       |         |         |          |          |          |
| **B**       |         |         | Y       |         |         |         |         |         | X       |          |          |          |

Here are some other twister weaves with the feeders in different counts. They
get progressively trickier. There are many other possible variations besides
these.

### PSPSP Twister Weave (Feeders share PSPSP, Feedees 5-Count)

| **Juggler** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   | **9**   | **10**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| **X**       | A       |         |         |         | C       |         |         | B       |         |          |
| **Y**       |         |         | B       |         |         | A       |         |         |         | C        |
| **A**       | X       |         |         |         |         | Y       |         |         |         |          |
| **B**       |         |         | Y       |         |         |         |         | X       |         |          |

### 3-Count Twister Weave (Feeders 3-Count, Feedees 5/4-Count)

For unbalanced weaves (where the weaver does a different count going inside-out
than outside-in) it generally seems easier to do the more challenging count (the
smaller one) on the outsides.

| **Juggler** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   | **9**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **X**       | A       |         |         | C       |         |         | B       |         |         |
| **Y**       |         |         | B       |         |         | A       |         |         | C       |
| **A**       | X       |         |         |         |         | Y       |         |         |         |
| **B**       |         |         | Y       |         |         |         | X       |         |         |
| **C**       |         |         |         | X       |         |         |         |         | Y       |

### Fast Twister Weave (Feeders 3 of 8, Feedees 4-Count)

| **Juggler** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   | **7**   | **8**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|

| **B**       | Y       |         |         |         | X       |         |         |         |
| **C**       |         |         | X       |         |         |         | Y       |         |

> * Both hands counting

There are lots of variations on the Twister Weave. See the Twister Plus, Double
Time Twister, etc.

We can add 2 clubs to the standard Twister Weave and make the passes from X and
Y to the weavers be triples (7 club 4-count between each side of the weave and
the feeder), and the return passes triples too.

Another variation is to add 2 extra clubs and have the feeders do 4-count in
fast popcorn (534p3).

Try the twister weave in chocolate bar too.

Original Twister Weave suggested by Mike Newton. Variations by MAJ.

### Twister Plus

This is a variation of the Twister Weave where the feeders use their right hand
selves to add an addition club passed back and forth over the top of the weave
in triples like in a 7 club 4-count. The weaving pattern is exactly the same as
the Standard Twister Weave.

| **Juggler** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **X**       | A       | T-Y     | C       | T-Y     | B       | T-Y     |
| **Y**       | T-X     | B       | T-X     | A       | T-X     | C       |
| **A**       | X       |         |         | Y       |         |         |
| **B**       |         | Y       |         |         | X       |         |
| **C**       |         |         | X       |         |         | Y       |

> * Right hands counting
> * Y starts with 4

Another nice variation is for the weavers to do 1/2 pirouettes under a triple
right to left self throw for their turn.

Also see Twister++ and Twister 5.

Pattern by MAJ.

### Double Time Twister

The Double-time Twister is the same as the Twister Weave with each weaver
passing twice to each feeder before turning around to pass twice to the other
feeder. Now each feeder is passing 2-count: passing twice to each weaver as they
go by.

| **Juggler** | **1**   | **2**   | **3**   | **4**   | **5**   | **6**   |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **X**       | A       | A       | C       | C       | B       | B       |
| **Y**       | C       | B       | B       | A       | A       | C       |
| **A**       | X       | X       |         | Y       | Y       |         |
| **B**       |         | Y       | Y       |         | X       |         |
| **C**       | Y       |         | X       | X       |         | Y       |

> * Right hands counting

For each weaver that A passes to, the first pass is made when the weaver is on
the outside. The weaver moves to the inside, following the arrows, for the
second pass. A is Mr. Outside In.

For each weaver that B passes to, the first pass is made when the weaver is in
the inside. Then the weaver moves to the outside, following the arrows, for the
second pass. B is Mr. Inside Out.

To see what the weavers do, lets look at what A does. A passes to X in the
outside position and then moves to the inside where the next pass is made to Y.
A has one right hand self throw to turn around and make the first throw to Y.
The first pass to Y is made when A is on the inside. A then moves to the outside
to make the second pass to Y and has one self throw to turn around and repeat
the pattern.

All weavers do the same thing two passes out of phase.

Pattern created by MAJ.

### Double Time Twister Plus

Here is a twister variation with 2 extra clubs where the passes to and from the
weave are all doubles like an extra club feed.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** | **10** | **11** | **12** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **X**       |       | D-A   |       | D-C   |       | D-C   |       | D-B   |       | D-B    |        | D-A    |
| **Y**       |       | D-B   |       | D-B   |       | D-A   |       | D-A   |       | D-C    |        | D-C    |

| **B**       |       |       | D-Y   |       | D-Y   |       |       |       | D-X   |        | D-X    |        |
| **C**       | D-Y   |       |       |       | D-X   |       | D-X   |       |       |        | D-Y    |        |

### Twister Popcorn

The Twister Popcorn is the same as the Popcorn Feed except there are 2 feeders,
one on each side, and each popcorn feedee passes to one, turns to pass to the
other, and repeats. The feedees do not weave in this pattern. That's the next
pattern. In this pattern they just turn in place. The feeders do a Typewriter
Feed.

![](./media/image39.jpeg)

The hardest position is the middle feedee, because he/she cannot cheat as much
into the turns. You can either turn fast during the single self, throw a right
to left single straight up in the air and do a 1/2 pirouette underneath it, or
throw a behind the back self to turn.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **X**       | D-A   |       | D-C   |       | D-B   |       |
| **Y**       |       | D-B   |       | D-A   |       | D-C   |

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       |T-self | D-X   |       |T-self | D-Y   |       |
| **B**       |       |T-self | D-Y   |       |T-self | D-X   |
| **C**       | D-Y   |       |T-self | D-    |       |T-self |

> * Right hands counting
> * X and C start with 4
> * A, B and C are 1 beat after X and Y

It's probably best to be quite comfortable with popcorn feeds before spending a lot of time on this pattern.

See all of those self throws? Well, you can fill some of them in by adding
another pass on every beat.

## Chocolate Feeds and Variations

### Chocolate Bar 3-Count Feed
![](./media/image44.png)

The Chocolate Bar feed is shares a 1-Count feed between two feeders. The
standard positions are 2 feeders facing 3 feedees. The Wedgee Positions are
another alternative pattern layout.

> * Both hands counting, right hand starts

Aidan Quinn worked out an extra club variation of this pattern. See his web site
under the Passing Resources section for more information. Basically the feeders
share an extra club ultimate feed, alternating two passes as chocolate bar.
Feeders pass straight and feedees pass cross.

A version with 2 extra clubs should be theoretically possible, with all passes
straight doubles.

Pattern by Steve Otteson and MAJ.

### Double Chocolate Double 3-Count Feed

Another pattern using the 2 facing 3 position.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | C     | C     | D     |
| **B**       | E     | D     | E     |
| **C**       | A     | A     |       |
| **D**       |       | B     | A     |
| **E**       | B     |       | B     |

> * Both hands counting
> * Right hand starts

Notice that the first 3 throws are R-L-R, and the next 3 throws are to the same
people but are L-R-L.

Pattern by Steve Otteson and MAJ.

### Semi-Sweet Chocolate 3-Count Feed

As far as the number of passes made by A and B go,the Semi-Sweet pattern is in between the Chocolate Bar and the Double Chocolate Bar patterns. Also uses the 2 facing 3 positions.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** |

### Chocolate Swirl
![](./media/image46.png)

The chocolate swirl is a moving extension of Double Chocolate Double Three
Count. It is noteworthy for jugglers moving from one side of the pattern to the
other with only a single self throw. That is possible. It is also noteworthy for
being hard, both to remember and to juggle.

The table shows a single transition where E moves to the other side.

Once you get comfortable with one transition at a time, then you can run the
transitions faster. Or so we imagine...we've never been that comfortable...

## Mango Swirl/Mangled Squirrel
![](./media/image47.png)

The Mango Swirl was an attempt to create a change sides pattern for the 2 extra
club W pattern. Unfortunately, our first attempts were more mangled than mango,
and more squirrelly than swirly and thus its alternate name. There are a couple
possible transitions. Although we originally created the pattern with a
different transition, this one seems easier (especially if you've practiced the
Extra Club Turbo).

> * Both hands counting, right hand passes
> * A and B start with 4, right hands
> * C starts with 3, right hand
> * C, D and E start with 3, left hands

In steady state, B is on a pause for beat 1, but throws D-E at the very start

In steady state, C moves on beat 1, but is in initial position for beat 1 at the
very start

E moves first by turning around and passing a triple to D. A moves second by
moving to the opposite side and throwing a triple to B, and so on.

The rhythm is move, triple, 2 passes, 1 pass, 2 passes. And repeat. Remember
Triple, 2-1-2.

Yeah, it's kind of tricky.

follow each pass as a feedee with a right to left self double, and follow each
feed sequence (at the very end) with a right to left self double.

Classic pattern. When were these patterns created? We have been doing them since
1992.

## Extra Club Rotating Feed
![](./media/image54.png)

Any feed or feast can be done with an extra club by throwing passes as doubles
and following every feedee pass and every feeder cycle with a self double to
restore the timing. A right to left self double switches left and rights.

This pattern is also in a star. A is the first feeder. This feed is shown
clockwise, but of course it could work either direction.

> * Both hands counting, all right hand passes are doubles
> * A starts with 4 clubs
> * A and E start with right hand
> * B, C and D start with left hand

The steady state right hand sequence is feed 3 passes, double self, then the
sequence self, pass, double self, self two times. Repeat.

## Extra Clubs Feast
![](./media/image55.png)

The feast is an extension to the 5 juggler feast and the 5 juggler Extra Club
Rotating Feed. The feeders alternate straight across right hand triples and
doubles to keep the timing working.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | Pause |       | D-E   |       | T-C   |
| **B**       |       | T-D   | Pause |       | D-A   |
| **C**       |       | D-B   |       | T-E   | Pause |
| **D**       | T-A   | Pause |       | D-C   |       |
| **E**       | D-D   |       | T-B   | Pause |       |

> * Both hands counting, all right hands are double or triple passes
> * D and E start with 4 clubs and right hands
> * On the very start only, A skips the pause and starts with a D-C on 1 with
    right hand
> * B and C start with left hand

Wow. Remember, if it were easy, then anyone could do it...

If that is just too crazy, then you can do the same pattern idea slower.

| **Juggler** | **1**  | **2**  | **3**  | **4**  | **5**  | **6** | **7** | **8**  | **9** | **10** |

> * Both hands counting, all right hands are double passes or double selves

## Whirling Melvish

Consider a 14 club box in 4-count. There's room in the middle for one or two
jugglers. If they pass with each of the corners while turning slowly in a
circle, that's the Whirling Melvish.

To make it easier, the Melvish (the juggler in the middle, who may or may not be
named Melonhead), can do 2 passes in a row to each corner.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** | **10** | **11** | **12** | **13** | **14** | **15** | **16** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A**       | T-C   |       | M     |       | T-C   |       | M     |       | T-C   |        |        |        | T-C    |        |        |        |
| **B**       |       | T-D   |       |       |       | T-D   |       |       |       | T-D    |        | M      |        | T-D    |        | M      |
| **C**       |       |       | T-A   |       |       |       | T-A   |       |       |        | T-A    |        |        |        | T-A    |        |
| **D**       |       |       |       | T-B   |       |       |       | T-B   |       |        |        | T-B    |        |        |        | T-B    |
| **M**       |       | D-B   | Pause |       |       |       | A     |       |       |        | D-B    | Pause  |        |        |        | M      |

> * Both hands counting
> * A and B start with 4 clubs
> * A, C and M start with right hand
> * B and D start on 2 with right hands

A single transition takes from beat 1 through beat 9. At 10 it starts over with
the next corner.

The Melvish passes a straight double, pauses and then does a normal 4-count pass
to one corner (A in this case), then turns and throws an early straight double
in 4-count to the next corner. Wait for 1 beat, then resume the 4-count. Moving
after every 2 passes (1 double and 1 single) is a nice timing.

You can add an additional Whirling Melvish juggler in the middle back to back to
the original mover. That juggler starts in a 4-count with C and does the same
thing as M, 2 beats later.

## Cathedral
![](./media/image58.jpeg)

The Cathedral is an extension of the GDP to 5 jugglers. It is a 4 leaf clover
with 2 extra clubs and all triple passes over the top. This is a spectacular
pattern, but challenging.

The outer box maintains a 14 club box in 4-count triples.

The center juggler passes once with a leaf and then replaces that leaf in a
6-count turn. The table below shows one transition, where E replaces A, and A
completes the transition facing B.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** | **8** | **9** | **10** | **11** | **12** | **13** | **14** | **15** | **16** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A**       | T-C   |       | E     |       | T-C   |       |       |       |       |        | D-B    | Pause  |        |        |        |        |
| **B**       |       | T-D   |       |       |       | T-D   |       |       |       | T-D    |        | A      |        | T-D    |        |        |
| **C**       |       |       | T-A   |       |       |       | T-A   |       |       |        | T-E    |        |        |        | T-E    |        |
| **D**       |       |       |       | T-B   |       |       |       | T-B   |       |        |        | T-B    |        |        |        | T-B    |
| **E**       |       | D-A   | Pause |       |       |       |       |       | T-C   |        |        |        | T-C    |        |        |        |

> * Both hands counting
> * Beats 1 through 9 make up a single transition.

## Star and Variations

![](./media/image59.png)

| **Juggler** | **R** | **L** |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | D     | C     |
| **B**       | E     | D     |
| **C**       | A     | E     |
| **D**       | B     | A     |
| **E**       | C     | B     |

> * 3-count or whatever you prefer

All passes are made at the same time. Try this pattern with 5-count, 3-count, 2
of 3 count or 1-count.

Classic pattern.

### Selfless Star

![](./media/image60.png)

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | B     | C     | D     | E     |
| **B**       | C     | D     | E     | A     |
| **C**       | D     | E     | A     | B     |
| **D**       | E     | A     | B     | C     |
| **E**       | A     | B     | C     | D     |

> * 3-count

You can extend this pattern to 2 of 3-count or even 1-count if you're feeling
ambitious (rights and lefts always go to opposite sides). Good luck with that.

When was this pattern created? We have been doing it since 1992.

### Extra-Club Stars
![](./media/image61.png)

There are lots of nice variations on a star with extra clubs. If you're
comfortable with 7 and 8 club passing patterns using left and right passes, try
these.

#### 4-Count Extra Club Star

In this straight forward variation, each juggler passes in a 4-count across and
to the right. This pattern has only right hand passes and right to left double
selves.

| **Juggler** | **1**  | **2**  | **3**  | **4**  | **5**  |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **A**       | D-D    |        | D-self | Pause  |        |
| **B**       | Pause  |        | D-E    |        | D-self |
| **C**       |        | D-self | Pause  |        | D-A    |
| **D**       |        | D-B    |        | D-self | Pause  |
| **E**       | D-self | Pause  |        | D-C    |        |

> * Both hands counting
> * A starts with 4
> * A, E start with right
> * B, C, D start with left (B starts with a Pause, so B actually starts with a
    right on beat 2)

#### 5-Count Extra Club Star

This is an extension of the 3-count extra club triangle. Each juggler passes
doubles in 5 count across and to the right. All passes cross (rights to right,
lefts to left).

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | D-D   |       |       |       |       |
| **B**       |       |       | D-E   |       |       |
| **C**       |       |       |       |       | D-A   |
| **D**       |       | D-B   |       |       |       |
| **E**       |       |       |       | D-C   |       |

> * Both hands counting
> * A starts with 4

All jugglers start with right hand

#### PSPSS Star

We can continue to add clubs and passes to the 5-Count star, until it is a
1-Count star with 20 clubs and all throws are crossing double passes. However,
that is really hard.

Here's a nice variation that is challenging but very doable and looks great. The
key to this pattern is precise timing. There are two doubles crossing the circle
on every beat and the timing must be exact so they don't collide. If there is
any variation, throw the first pass a little late and the second pass a little
fast.

| **Juggler** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A**       | D-D   |       | D-D   |       |       |
| **B**       |       |       | D-E   |       | D-E   |
| **C**       |       | D-A   |       |       | D-A   |
| **D**       |       | D-B   |       | D-B   |       |
| **E**       | D-C   |       |       | D-C   |       |

> * Both hands counting
> * A and E starts with 4
> * All jugglers start with right hand

### Triply Star
![](./media/image62.png)

In this star a triple pass goes around the pattern. Single passes take up the
extra time.

If you want to get crazy, note that each juggler has 2 right selves in a row.
That's exactly enough time for each juggler to do a triple self with a pirouette
and stay in time.

If you need to mellow it out, you can remove all the single passes and just pass
a triple around in 10-count.

Here's another variation with triple selves instead of triple passes.

| **A**       | T-self | D      |        | C      | D      |

| **C**       | A      |        | E      | A      | T-self |
| **D**       | B      | T-self | B      |        | A      |
| **E**       |        | B      | C      | T-self | C      |

There could be many more interesting star variations based on siteswaps that are
passed from one star point to the next. I've seen a few demonstrated at European
conventions.

Pattern by Luke Emery.

### 20 Club Star

 This classic pattern is just a star where every juggler starts with 4 clubs
and does 2-count doubles to the juggler across and to the right.

It's a good study in timing.

Another classic pattern.

### Twirly Star

Here's a simple and easy variation on the Shooting Star, but with 5 people and
less moving.

> * Right hand counting, 2-count
> * E starts with 2 clubs

Make sure to keep the count after the pirouette! (At first you can just pause
for 2 counts instead of pirouetting.) You'll pirouette holding 2 clubs.

## Quincunx

Ahhh...Quincunx. We don't actually juggle this pattern. We just talk about it.
Whenever we can't think of a pattern to try, someone inevitably says, “Let's do
Quincunx!” Then we all laugh. Ha, ha! Ok, seriously. What should we do?

With no disrespect for Mike intended, this is kind of a dumb pattern. It's
complicated and almost impossible to remember for a full cycle. I haven't done
this pattern in at least 8 years, and I don't think anyone else in the MAJ has
either. (Melonhead says he still likes it...)

Now that it's a part of the MAJ mythology though, we can't take it out of the
pattern book. Maybe you should try it for yourself and see what you think!
