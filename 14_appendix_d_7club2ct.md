Appendix D? â€“ 7 Club 2-Count Exposed
====================================

Seven clubs is the playground for the serious club passer. Six clubs is easy. Eight is hard. Seven is just right.

So you know 7 club 2-count? That's great! But, wait, do you really? Let's take a closer look.

The standard 7 club 2-count consists of right handed passes as doubles and left handed single spin selves.

1.  4p3 | 34p

This pattern can of course be done with left handed passes too.

1.  34p | 4p3 left handed

By changing the height of the throws, the pattern can also be done with single spins.

1.  3.5p 3.5 | 3.5p 3.5

2.  3.5 3.5p | 3.5 3.5 left handed

Now, speaking of spins, all kinds of spin combinations are possible. One juggler can throw doubles while the other throws singles, or triples versus doubles. Even though the patterns are quite doable, that makes the timing a bit wonky. However, if one juggler throws triples while the other throws singles, then the timing locks in to a new simple siteswap. (Have the juggler passing single passes start with 4 and juggle with their right hands in sync with the juggler throwing triple passes.)

1.  5p3 | 3p3

2.  35p | 33p left handed

It's a curious and useful fact that any 7 club passing pattern can be modified by changing all the straight passes to crosses and all the cross passes to straights. This is actually applicable to all passing patterns, but for 6 and 8 club passing patterns many such variations lead to collision problems. For 7 club passing, however, a majority of the crossed patterns still work.

Each of the patterns we've discussed so far can also be juggled in a crossed version, where both jugglers cross passes. This means that one juggler will be making left hand passes (in 2-count) and the partner will be making right hand passes.

Crossed versions of above.

1.  Crossed version of doubles 2-count, both right and left handed: 4px3 | 34p.

2.  Crossed version of singles 2-count, both right and left handed: 3.5px 3.5 | 3.5 3.5px.

3.  Crossed version of triple/singles 2-count, both right and left handed: 5px3 | 3px3.

Because of symmetry, there are really only 9 unique patterns so far instead of 12. The left hand versions and the right hand versions turn into the same pattern when the jugglers cross passes.

As we've seen from Appendix B, every passing pattern has a corresponding complementary dual pattern (or shadow pattern) where a juggler's right hand pattern is combined with the left hand pattern off the adjacent juggler. This is really just one permutation of a 4 person 2 handed site swap. Each of the 9 patterns above has a corresponding shadow person pattern, and curiously, they are all 2-count, more or less. Let's look at a couple more closely.

1.  The shadow pattern for the standard 4p3 is a synchronous juggling pattern where the left and right hands of a juggler throw and catch at exactly the same time. For this pattern the left hand will throw a crossing double self while the right hand throws a straight single pass: (4x, 3p) | (4x, 3p). The second juggler pauses 1/2 beat before throwing their 2 synchronous throws: one as a pass and the other as a self.

2.  The same pattern can be done left handed (3p, 4x) | (3p, 4x).

3.  If we change all the straight passes to crosses, then both 10 and 11 transform into the same pattern: (3px, 4x) | (4x, 3px).

The synchronous versions are very interesting 7 club 2-count patterns in their own right, and are a great foundation for epxloring other synchronous patterns. You can switch back and forth from left handed to right handed throws (still in 2-count, sort of) to make a fantastic 7 club pattern. One juggler will need to throw crosses while the other throws straights.

1.  Switching sync throws. (4x, 3px) (3px, 4x) | (3p, 4x) (4x, 3p).

This is in the same family as Will Murray's fantastic 7 club Scratch Your Head pattern, which is the same except the double self crosses and straights are switched.

1.  Scratch Your Head. (4, 3px) (3px, 4) | (4, 3p) (3p, 4).

That's still kind of a 2-count pattern!

The single spin version of seven 2-count doesn't change when you look at the associated dual pattern (7 1-count singles is the same way).

However, the triples/singles version makes an interesting set of dual pattern variations, still in 2-count!

1.  Fast lop-sided popcorn: 53p | 33p.

2.  Of course it can be done left handed: 3p5 | 3p3.

3.  And theoretically, with crossing passes: 53px | 33px. This one doesn't work too well, because there is a collision problem with the 2 crossing singles.

4.  And 20 again, with left hand self triples: 3px5 | 3px3. This one doesn't work very well either because of collisions.

Had enough? Well, there are more where those come from. Next, we look at combinations where one side does a synchronous pattern and the other does an asynchronous pattern. These are handy patterns when one juggler wants to try synchronous variations, but the other passer isn't ready for that yet.

1.  Here's the simplest: (3p, 4x) | 4p3.

2.  Now left handed: (4x, 3p) | 4p3 left handed.

3.  And, or course, crossing right handed: (3px, 4x) | 4px3.

4.  And crossing left handed: (4x, 3px) | 4px3 left handed.

Now try some variations where the extra clubs and synchronization are both on one side. They are asymmetric 2-counts, but that can be good if you have a mixture of passing skill levels.

1.  One juggler throwing both doubles synced (4p, 4x) | 3p3.

2.  And left handed (4x, 4p) | 33p.

3.  And crossing (4x, 4px) | 3px3.

4.  And crossing left handed (4px, 4x) | 33px.

There's a good start, but there are many many more without leaving 7 clubs with only doubles and single passes. Try some of these variations next time your passing partners says they're bored with 7 club 2-count.

So you know 7 club popcorn? That's great! But wait...do you really...?
